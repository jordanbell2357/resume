## Professional Experience

### Canadian Tire, Toronto
**Data Science Associate, June 2022 - August 2023**
- Efficiently create data-driven solutions using techniques like regression analysis, regularization, SARIMAX to build out complex models.
- Blended pure data science methods with business insights to satisfy stakeholders and gain traction for these solutions, while adhering to high standards of statistical rigor.
- Member of a team building an operational system for optimizing product placement according to constraints, using mixed integer programming (MIP) to generate plans for aisles that are organic and based on store data.
- Optimization for product placement on shelves according to constraints, using mixed integer programming (MIP). The language of the project is Python using COIN-OR, PuLP, and Pyomo.
- Developed store similarity metrics to answer questions like "What stores are most similar to mine in folding chair sales?", or generally "What stores are most similar to mine?".
- Initiated building a pipeline from Google Analytics for page views of products, for potential use with store similarity metrics.
- Built a data pipeline and dashboard for measuring store participation in Canadian Tire deals using SQL. Designed a table, handling a complex situation of deals, normalizing durations, and calculating the number of participating stores. Created a robust and productionizable SQL query to populate a table, which can be run periodically and analyzed as a database table in a dashboard.
- Collaborated using Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence, and Microsoft Teams for projects and communications.


### Consilium Crypto, Toronto
**Data Science Intern, January 2019 - April 2019**
- Tested time series predictions using logistic regression models in scikit-learn.

### Selected Self-Directed Projects
#### [USCG NAIS Data Project](https://github.com/jordanbell2357/uscg-nais-data), Toronto, 2018 - Present
- Utilized AIS data to estimate shipping activity such as the number of port visits by vessels in the US in 2022.
- Created visualizations showing positions and flows of movement, and compared data with governmental organizations.

### Additional Experience
Mentored students, developed syllabus, delivered lectures, graded work. Developed communication skills to discuss technical materials with non-technical students.
